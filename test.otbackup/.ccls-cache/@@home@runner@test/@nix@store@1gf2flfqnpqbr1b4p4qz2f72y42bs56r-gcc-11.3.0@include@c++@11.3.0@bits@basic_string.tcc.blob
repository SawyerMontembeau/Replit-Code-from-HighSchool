the @a __n characters\n starting at @a __pos.  Returns an integer < 0 if the\n substring is ordered before @a __str, 0 if their values are\n equivalent, or > 0 if the substring is ordered after @a\n __str.  Determines the effective length rlen of the strings\n to compare as the smallest of the length of the substring\n and @a __str.size().  The function then compares the two\n strings by calling\n traits::compare(substring.data(),str.data(),rlen).  If the\n result of the comparison is nonzero returns it, otherwise\n the shorter one is ordered
